# Alfred Screen Sharing
Easily start a screen sharing session directly from Alfred.

![Workflow Icon](https://github.com/jtvhk/alfred-screen-sharing/raw/master/Alfred-Workflow.png)

This workflow was created for Alfred 3. At the moment, it:

- Copies your query to clipboard
- Opens the Screen Sharing app
- Uses a keyboard shortcut to start a new connection
- Pastes the VNC address or Apple ID entered as a query
- Presses "Enter" to begin the session

Admittedly this is a lazy approach, so pull requests to improve the workflow's capabilities are welcomed.
